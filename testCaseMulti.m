%% ================ Part 2: Gradient Descent ================

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: We have provided you with the following starter
%               code that runs gradient descent with a particular
%               learning rate (alpha). 
%
%               Your task is to first make sure that your functions - 
%               computeCost and gradientDescent already work with 
%               this starter code and support multiple variables.
%
%               After that, try running gradient descent with 
%               different values of alpha and see which one gives
%               you the best result.
%
%               Finally, you should complete the code at the end
%               to predict the price of a 1650 sq-ft, 3 br house.
%
% Hint: By using the 'hold on' command, you can plot multiple
%       graphs on the same figure.
%
% Hint: At prediction, make sure you do the same feature normalization.

fprintf('Running gradient descent ...\n');

% Choose some alpha value
alpha = 0.01;
num_iters = 400;

% Init Theta and Run Gradient Descent 
theta = zeros(k+1, 1);
[theta, J_history] = gradientDescentMulti(X, y, theta, alpha, num_iters);

% Plot the convergence graph
figure;
plot(1:numel(J_history), J_history, '-b', 'LineWidth', 2);
xlabel('Number of iterations');
ylabel('Cost J');

% Display gradient descent's result
fprintf('Theta computed from gradient descent: \n');
fprintf(' %f \n', theta);
fprintf('\n');

% Estimate the price of a 1650 sq-ft, 3 br house
% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Recall that the first column of X is all-ones. Thus, it does
% not need to be normalized.
